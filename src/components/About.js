        <div>
            My name is Mark Protsyuk, and I am from the Sacramento Area! As you can tell, I am a software developer and I am relatively new to the game. Besides programing, some other things that I enjoy doing are drawing, creating art, cooking, and climbing. Climbing has got to be one of my favorite pass time hobbies! I enjoy spending as obsessive amount of time trying to figure out a route or a new bouldering problem. Yes, the other hobbies do indeed get my creative side working, but climbing really makes me think hard and push myself to do more than I thought I could. Hopefully this was a good little meaningful introduction about myself and I hope to introduce myself in a workspace sometime soon!
